# Intro

I am currently a Second Year Applied AI & Analytics student at [Singapore Polytechnic](https://sp.edu.sg) where I experiment on projects on a wide variety of topics, such as
Data Engineering, MLOps, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Analytics and Visualization.

# Present

At SP, I have learned how to build teams, manage people, shape culture, develop relations with colleagues, and predictive models with technologies like [Dask](https://dask.org/), [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), and [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/). Although I aim to specialize in Data Science & Analytics, I am keen to delve deeper into other regions of the Computing subspace.
